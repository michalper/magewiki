# MageWiki-AI — project rules for Claude Code

This file is the single source of truth for architecture decisions, data model, RAG design, phase plan, and working method. It is a transcription of the project's planning document (2026-11-04). Established decisions below are **settled and should not be changed without explicit justification** discussed with the user first.

## Goal and scope

MageWiki-AI is a universal catalog of Magento 2 modules with an AI agent: it scans code, analyzes it with an LLM, stores the knowledge in a database, and lets PMs and developers ask natural-language questions (e.g. "do we have a module with a Klaviyo integration?"). This is a portfolio project on GitHub (`michalper/magewiki`) — it must ship as **finished**, not sprawling.

- **Universal**: works on any Magento 2.3/2.4+ store, no hardcoded paths. Sources: `app/code`, `vendor`, and `app/etc/config.php` (enabled/disabled status).
- **Read-only**: scanned code is never modified; no README files are ever written into scanned modules.
- **Knowledge lives in the database**: each module's description is a JSON record; Markdown is rendered on demand. Optional `.md` export is allowed and always writes outside the scanned project.
- **The agent answers only from collected data**, citing module and file; no results means "not found."
- **Version 1.0** = Phases 0–5: scanner, hash+diff, AI analysis with cache and budget, DB with vectors, agent with citations, chat UI and module page. Later: cron/webhook, BYOK in the UI, Ollama, dependency graph, plugin-conflict detection, evaluation.

## Architecture and stack (settled)

One Python backend, one Postgres database with extensions, one `docker compose up`.

| Layer | Technology | Role / decision |
|---|---|---|
| Backend API | Python, FastAPI, async SQLAlchemy, Alembic | Single backend, no Node.js server-side; webhooks use HMAC |
| Parsing | tree-sitter-php, lxml | PHP via tree-sitter (Python's `ast` module only reads Python); XML: di, events, webapi, crontab, db_schema |
| Database & vectors | PostgreSQL + pgvector (HNSW), tsvector, pg_trgm | Relational data, text, and vectors in one DB; no separate Qdrant/Milvus |
| Queue & cron | ARQ + Redis | Natively async; not Celery |
| LLM | LiteLLM, default DeepSeek, optional Ollama | BYOK; no LangChain in the core — the agent loop is a few dozen lines |
| Embeddings | OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` or local `bge-m3` | Configured separately from the LLM (DeepSeek has no embeddings API) |
| Frontend | React via Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query | Chat via SSE (`fetch` + `ReadableStream`), not WebSocket; types generated with `openapi-typescript` |
| Deployment | Docker Compose | Scanned code is mounted `:ro` |

**Phase 3 deviation (recorded 2026-11-05):** Phase 3's AI analysis (`analyze_file` / `synthesize_module`) is implemented and verified against **Anthropic Claude** rather than DeepSeek, because real Anthropic API billing was available for genuine end-to-end verification this phase (model configured via `LLM_MODEL` in `.env`, default `anthropic/claude-haiku-5-5` — verify the exact LiteLLM model string empirically against the installed `litellm` package, the same discipline already used for `tree-sitter-php` and `arq`/`pytest-asyncio` in earlier phases). LiteLLM itself remains the abstraction layer — only the configured provider/model changed. DeepSeek and Ollama remain the stated production default per the `LLM` row above and stay wired as dormant BYOK options (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` in `.env.example`); switching back is a config change, not a code change.

Don't mix model roles: Claude Code is the tool used to *write* the application; in production the application itself uses DeepSeek (cost) or a BYOK model.

**Phase 8 decision (recorded 2026-11-06):** Kubernetes manifests use **Kustomize**, not Helm — `kubectl` has Kustomize built in (no extra tooling), and plain YAML + a `kustomization.yaml` fits a single-environment (`kind`) demo better than a chart's templating layer. See `k8s/`. The scan `CronJob` is additive to the app's own internal ARQ cron (`cron(nightly_scan_all, ...)` in `app/tasks/worker.py`, already running wherever the worker Deployment runs) — it demonstrates the k8s-native primitive by hitting `POST /scan` against the committed `tests/fixtures/demo-store` fixture, not a replacement for the in-process schedule.

## Scan, cron, and cost control

Re-analysis by AI runs only for files whose hash changed — a scan with no changes costs 0 tokens.

- **SHA256 hash per file**, diff per file (added/changed/removed). Removed files delete their chunks so chat doesn't hallucinate classes that no longer exist.
- **Module state machine**: `pending → scanning → analyzing → embedding → up_to_date`, plus `failed` (with `retry_count` and `last_error`) and `paused_budget`. A module is up to date when `analyzed_hash = current_hash`; after a crash, the worker knows what to resume.
- **Flow**: cron or webhook → `scan_repository` → diff → queue → `analyze_file` → `synthesize_module` (map-reduce over file summaries) → `embed_chunks`.
- **Idempotency**: `job_id = analyze:{file}:{hash}`, plus a Postgres advisory lock for the whole scan — two overlapping scans never duplicate work.
- **Cache**: `analysis_cache` table keyed by `(content_hash, model, prompt_version)`; changing the prompt invalidates the cache, and reverting a file costs nothing.
- **Budget**: `LLM_MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD` is checked before every LLM call; once exceeded, jobs move to `paused_budget`.
- **Cron and webhook**: a nightly differential scan (e.g. `0 3 * * *`) is the safety net; a webhook from CI/CD (HMAC-signed, stable `_job_id` as debounce) gives speed. Both call the same `scan_repository` function.

## AI analysis and the README-in-the-database model

The AI returns structured JSON stored in the `module_docs` table (`jsonb` column); the README is only a view rendered from a template. Facts come from parsers; only interpretation comes from AI.

| JSON field | Content |
|---|---|
| `summary`, `description` | What the module does, business and technical |
| `features` | List of features, each with a `source` file reference; a feature without a source is rejected by validation |
| `integrations` | External systems (Klaviyo, InPost, ERP) |
| `tags` | From a controlled vocabulary; new tags wait for approval |
| `config_options`, `risks`, `confidence` | Keys from `system.xml`, risks, description confidence |
| `pm` / `dev` sections | Two text variants: without class names, and with classes/hooks/config |

Anti-hallucination rules:

- Lists of events, plugins, crons, endpoints, tables, and dependencies are inserted by parser code; the AI never invents them.
- `unknown` is allowed instead of guessing; code takes precedence over a module's own README.
- Tags carry `source` (`parser` or `ai`) and `confidence`. Deterministic signals (`composer.json`, a dependency on `Magento_Payment`, interfaces, `config.xml`) reinforce AI-assigned tags.
- Starter tag vocabulary: `payments`, `shipping`, `marketing`, `erp`, `search`, `seo`, `checkout`, `admin-tools`, `performance`, `b2b`.
- README is stored together with `content_hash`, `model`, and `prompt_version`, so staleness is always knowable.

## RAG and the agent

Agentic RAG over hybrid search in Postgres: an agent with tools (tool calling via LiteLLM) answers only from data in the database and cites sources.

**Hybrid retriever** combines three signals via RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion, k=60):

| Signal | Technology | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| Semantic | pgvector + HNSW | Intent: "email marketing", "parcel lockers" |
| Keyword | `tsvector` | Class names, config keys, `klaviyo.com` |
| Identifiers | `pg_trgm` | `Vendor_Module`, typos, name fragments |

**Multi-level index**: module README (top level) → per-file summaries → code fragments (methods, XML blocks) for citation only. Chunking follows code structure, not character count. Source code for citations lives in the database; `read_file` reads from the database, not disk.

**Agent tools**: `search_modules`, `get_module`, `get_dependencies`, `find_by_event`, `find_by_class`, `read_file(path, lines)`, `list_modules`.

**Question routing**:

| Question type | Tool |
|---|---|
| "Do we have a Klaviyo integration?", "how does the module send data?" | Hybrid search + module card + `read_file` |
| "Show all payment modules", "how many…" | `list_modules` (SQL over tags/integrations/status) with total count and pagination |
| "Who listens to this event?", "who overrides this class?" | `find_by_event`, `find_by_class` (SQL) |

Enumeration questions go through SQL, because top-k retrieval doesn't guarantee completeness by nature.

**Response**: SSE stream with `sources`, `token`, `done` (token usage) events. `audience` modes: `pm` (business language, no class names) and `dev` (classes, paths, events). The response includes the last scan date and module status (enabled vs. on-disk only).

System prompt enforces: answer only from tool results, every claim cited, no results means "not found."

Explicitly **not** chosen: pure vector RAG, GraphRAG, a separate vector database, LangChain as the core. Post-1.0: reranking, query rewriting, a retrieval-debugging panel in the UI.

## Test data

Always **public code** (e.g. a local clone of `magento/magento2`, or other publicly available modules), **never confidential client code**. The repo is public from day one — no secrets and no NDA-covered client code ever enter the commit history.

The `Ordo_Automation` module (at `/Users/michalper/Projects/magento-ordo-test/vendor-src-sync` on the author's machine) is the author's own **public product**, not confidential client code — it is allowed as scanner test/fixture data from Phase 1 onward (referenced by path/env var, not copied into this repo).

## Phase plan

MVP = Phases 0–5. Each phase is done separately: first a plan for approval, then code with tests, then a small commit. Don't skip phases.

| Phase | Goal | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Repo skeleton, docker-compose, migrations, `.env.example` | `docker compose up` starts the database, API, and web |
| 1 | Scanner without AI: module discovery, XML/composer/PHP parsers, saved to the DB | Dashboard shows the module list from a demo scan |
| 2 | Per-file hash, diff, module states | A second scan with no changes creates 0 tasks |
| 3 | AI analysis: JSON schema, tag dictionary, cache, cost tracking, budget, README rendered from the DB | Module descriptions and cost are visible in the DB |
| 4 | Embeddings and hybrid retriever (vector + FTS + trigram, RRF) | A query returns the right files |
| 5 | Agent with tools, SSE chat, citations, pm/dev modes | Clickable sources in the UI |
| 6 | Cron, HMAC webhook, BYOK, Ollama, dependency graph | Nightly scan runs unattended |
| 7 | Evaluation suite (recall@k, MRR, negative/enumeration questions), README, GIF | Results in the README, vector vs. FTS vs. hybrid chart |
| 7b | CI/CD: GitHub Actions (lint, tests, Docker build, RAG eval on PR) | recall@k posted as a PR comment |
| 8 | Kubernetes: Helm or Kustomize, scan CronJob, tested on `kind` | Full stack runs on a local cluster |
| 9 | Parser-only quality checks (composer completeness, README presence, `@deprecated`, hardcoded secrets, test presence) + badge/KPI-ring UI foundation | New checks show up as badges on the module list and a stats page with KPI rings |
| 10 | Dependency intelligence: CVE/security-advisory check + abandoned/outdated check | A module with a known-vulnerable dependency shows a blocking CVE badge citing the advisory |
| 11 | Multi-repo fleet view | A repos-list page aggregates health across every repo MageWiki has scanned |
| 12 | PHP static-analysis toolchain (PHPStan/PHPMD/phpcs/PhpMetrics/Rector) — optional/stretch, needs explicit sign-off before starting given the PHP-toolchain architecture change | Equivalent scanners run against a module and their findings show up as badges |
| 13 | One cloud (GCP or Azure) via Terraform, managed Postgres + pgvector | Public demo deployment |

Version 1.0 ships before Phases 7b–9: a finished project with six technologies beats an unfinished one with ten.

### Backlog: porting ideas from v1

The author previously built a PHP tool for his employer Cognize — the predecessor MageWiki-AI (the open-source Python rewrite) succeeds, referred to here only as "v1" since it's Cognize's property. Phases 9–12 above come from a curated review of what v1 does in production; the full inventory (what's ported, what's skipped as Cognize-internal, and the detailed CVE-check design) lives in `docs/v1-port-roadmap.md`. Nothing here is copied code — concepts only, per the "no client-confidential code" rule below.

## Working method

- Start each phase in plan mode; propose a plan and wait for approval before writing code.
- Require tests alongside code (fixture: a small module under `backend/tests/fixtures/`).
- Reset context between phases.
- Record new decisions in this file as they're made.
- Repo language is English: README, docs, comments, commit messages, UI.
- The repo is public from day one: no secrets, no client-confidential code, ever, in commit history.
